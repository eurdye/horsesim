# Horse Simulator Remastered
A text adventure written in Python using Flask.

Horse Simulator Remastered is a loose remake of my 2014 game *Horse Simulator*. HSR is designed to be played in browser. Players can navigate and explore the world by typing in text commands like `go north` or `look` to interact with the game. All gameplay is done through a command line interface.

### Installation Instructions
1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary Python modules.
2. Run `source virt/bin/activate` to activate the Python venv. 
3. Run `python server.py` to start the server.
4. Visit 127.0.0.1:5000 in browser to play.

### Todo
* Implement real-time clock, calendar, moon phases, tides
    * Moon phases currently partially implemented

### License
I don't know what license to use right now, but I'd like to use an open-source license at some point. I will figure this out when I make more progress on this game. Right now all code (C) me.
