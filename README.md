# Horse Simulator Remastered
A text adventure written in Python using Flask.

Horse Simulator Remastered is a loose remake of my 2014 game *Horse Simulator*. HSR is designed to be played in browser. Players can navigate and explore the world by typing in text commands like `go north` or `look` to interact with the game. All gameplay is done through a command line interface.

1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary Python modules.
